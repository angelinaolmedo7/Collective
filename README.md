# Collective

Collective is an app for collectors of all things—memorabilia, cards, trinkets, and more—to gather to share and discuss their collections. Forum-based discussions are hosted by category and subcategory (Ex: Cards, Baseball cards), and users can track their progress for collections based on completion percentage (when relevant), quantity, and compared to other users. Leaderboards show who’s on top of each category and subcategory.
